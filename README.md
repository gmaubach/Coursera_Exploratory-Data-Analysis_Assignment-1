# Instruction on Reproducibility

- I have included the R code for making the plots each in a separate file.  
- However, it would be easier for you to run the main program named "2017-03-14_Assignment-1_Program.R" cause it contains all code needed to download the data, prepare everything and create the plots.

# Additional Note

- I included code to clean the Global workspace of your R environment and the directory tree after running the script.
- Do use this you should uncomment the code under section "cat("#Â  [ Cleanup ] ------------------------------------\n")".

# Feedback

- If you would like to give additional feedback, have comments, ask questions or get in touch with me, please mailto:gmaubach@users.noreply.github.com .
